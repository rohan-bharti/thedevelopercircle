# The Developer Circle

## A community of developers to practice Interview Coding Problems.

### Given below is the plan we are going to follow for now:
```
1. Pick up 5 Leetcode problems prior to a week (2-Easy and 3-Medium)
2. Everyone will solve the problems prior to the Sunday group meeting
3. The final solutions for the problems are supposed to be commited in your respective folders before the weekly meeting
4. In the meeting, each person will pick a problem (or two) to discuss their approach for the problem
5. We'll be using Notion to plan the questions (and other relevant stuff), Notion page will be our handbook going forward
6. The meeting will be for 60-90 mins. Majority of the portion will be for discussing the solutions and the remaining to plan the upcoming week
7. We'll be switching members weekly to pick 5 questions for the upcoming week
8. Lastly, let's gear the f up and kickass for any coding interview that comes our way
```

### Code Submission Guidelines
```
1. It is expected to submit the solutions prior to the weekly meeting
2. Follow the template in each of your folders for submitting your code
3. You can use any language you're comfortable with
4. Use CamelCase naming convention for file names as per the problem
