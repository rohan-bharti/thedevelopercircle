# The Developer Circle

## A community of developers to practice Interview Coding Problems.

### Given below is the plan we are going to follow for now:
```
1. Pick up 5 Leetcode problems prior to a week (2-Easy and 3-Medium)
2. The final solutions for the problems are supposed to be commited to github
3. Using Notion to plan the questions (and other relevant stuff), Notion page will be the handbook for tracking purposes
```

### Code Submission Guidelines
```
1. Submit all the problems by Sunday each week
2. Follow the template for code formatting and naming conventions
3. Any language can be used for coding purposes
4. Use CamelCase naming convention for file names as per the problem
```
